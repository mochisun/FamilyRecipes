# FamilyRecipes
I want to create a cute website with some classic family recipes

directory <melinda_recipes_docx_files> is a list of all recipes my mom has gathered from her lovely time here on earth (all .docx files)

program <docxToText.py> will pull all data from the recipe directory, store them in individual classes, and then spit out a large .json file with well formated recipes
